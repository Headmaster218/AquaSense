# Intelligent Waterborne Fecal Contamination Monitoring System

This project presents a **low-cost, deployable, AI-integrated platform** for monitoring fecal contamination in natural waters. By using **inorganic water quality parameters** (e.g., DO, PH, turbidity, conductivity) as surrogate inputs, the system predicts **E. coli concentration** and collects physical water samples for future validation. It integrates **real-time sensing, wireless transmission, machine learning inference, data visualization, and automated water sampling**, forming a complete perception–prediction–collection loop.
